# SHRMS — Intelligent Workflow Routing
# Task 5 of 7 — Main Orchestrator (Evaluation + Leave Application paths)
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS:
#   The main orchestrator for the IPCR evaluation routing.
#   This is what your web controller calls when a form is submitted.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   It runs both layers in sequence:
#     Layer 1 → Rule Engine   (rule_engine.py)  — compliance check
#     Layer 2 → Decision Tree (decision_tree.py) — routing prediction
#
# STRICTLY FOLLOWS workflow.png (evaluation path — right side):
