# org_and_rules_no_pmt.py
# SHRMS — Intelligent Workflow Routing
# Knowledge Base — Backup (No PMT Evaluator for Department Head)
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS:
#   A backup of org_and_rules.py saved before the PMT (Performance Management
#   Team) evaluator was assigned to the Department Head (EMP-001).
#
#   In this version:
#     - EMP-001 (John Reyes) has supervisor_id = None
#     - The Department Head cannot submit an IPCR through this system
#     - Rule 2 in check_ipcr() blocks EMP-001 with:
#       "John Reyes is the Department Head and cannot be evaluated
#        through this system."
#
# WHEN TO USE:
#   Swap this file in as org_and_rules.py if the LGU decides that the
#   Department Head's performance evaluation is handled outside the system
#   (e.g., manually or through a separate provincial-level process) and
#   does not need to be routed through the Smart HRMS.
#
# HOW TO SWAP IN:
#   1. Rename the current org_and_rules.py → org_and_rules_pmt.py
#   2. Rename this file → org_and_rules.py
#   3. Run python tests.py to confirm TC-RE-002 passes as expected
#      (expects status=returned for EMP-001 submission)
#   No retraining of Decision Tree models is needed.
#
# CONTAINS:

#   2. Civil Service leave rules (from CSC Omnibus Rules on Leave)
#   3. IPCR passing threshold   (from CSC Performance Evaluation guidelines)
#   4. Decision Tree encodings  (maps text values to integers for the ML model)

# 3. IPCR PASSING THRESHOLD
#    Source: CSC Performance Evaluation Guidelines
#
#    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOUR THESIS DEFENSE:
#    Your draft flowchart (workflow.png) shows "Rating < 3 = Failed".
#    The correct CSC standard is 2.5 — Satisfactory is the minimum passing mark.
#    This code uses 2.5 to match your thesis manuscript and CSC guidelines.
#    You should update your flowchart to say "< 2.5" before your final defense.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPCR_PASSING_SCORE = 2.5   # Ratings >= 2.5 are passing (Satisfactory and above)

# IPCR Evaluator Override (Option B)
#
# None   → each employee is evaluated by their own immediate supervisor
#          (standard CSC rule, correct for large offices)
#
# "EMP-001" → every employee in this office is evaluated by the Department Head
#             (set this when your LGU confirms a small-office exception)
#
# Change this one value to switch the entire office routing behavior.

#      - workflow_router.py (when preparing a prediction request)
#    If the encodings don't match, the model will predict incorrectly.
