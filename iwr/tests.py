# SHRMS — Intelligent Workflow Routing
# Task 6 of 7 — Black-Box Functional Test Suite (IPCR + Leave paths)
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS:
#   The formal black-box functional test suite for the Intelligent Workflow
#   Routing System — covering both the IPCR evaluation path and the Leave
#   Application path.
#
# THESIS REQUIREMENT:
#   "Functional Testing for rule-based workflow and decision tree algorithm
#    using Blackbox." — Objectives section of your manuscript
#
# WHAT BLACK-BOX TESTING MEANS:
#   We only test INPUT → OUTPUT behavior.
#   We do NOT look at or test internal code logic.
#   Each test defines:
#     - A real employee from the org chart
#     - A specific scenario from the flowchart
#     - The exact expected output
#   PASS = actual output matches expected
#   FAIL = it does not
#
# TEST CASE STRUCTURE:
#   Each test case directly maps to a step or diamond in the workflow diagrams.
#   The test ID format is:
#     TC-RE-XXX  = Test Case, Rule Engine (IPCR), number
#     TC-DT-XXX  = Test Case, Decision Tree (IPCR), number
#     TC-LV-XXX  = Test Case, Leave Application, number
#
# TEST BLOCKS:
#   ── IPCR Evaluation Path ──────────────────────────────────────────
#   BLOCK 1 — Rule Engine Tests          (TC-RE-001 to TC-RE-006)   6 cases
#   BLOCK 2 — Fresh Submission Tests     (TC-DT-001 to TC-DT-036)  20 cases
#             All 20 eligible employees covered (Dept Head excluded)
#   BLOCK 3 — Boundary and Rating Scale  (TC-DT-010 to TC-DT-019)  10 cases
#             Full 1.0–5.0 scale + all critical boundary points
#   BLOCK 4 — Remarks Path Tests         (TC-DT-020 to TC-DT-025)   6 cases
#             No-remarks and with-remarks for 3 supervisor groups
#
#   ── Leave Application Path ────────────────────────────────────────
#   BLOCK 5 — Leave Rule Engine Tests    (TC-LV-001 to TC-LV-014)  14 cases
#             One case per CSC leave compliance rule
#   BLOCK 6 — Leave DT Routing Tests     (TC-LV-015 to TC-LV-030)  16 cases
#             All 4 routing classes, all leave types, multiple employees
#   BLOCK 7 — DH as Applicant           (TC-LV-031 to TC-LV-034)   4 cases
